# Project-SQL-Oscar-DB
## Entity-relationship diagram for the database for collecting information on the [Oscar Film Academy Award ...](https://github.com/vassylkorzh/Project-SQL-Oscar-DB/blob/main/Oskar_description.docx)
  It will store the data of the person (artist, screenwriter, or director who was nominated for an Oscar and won it), the ceremony itself (its number and year of conducting), the award (category), and the film (which was nominated for an Oscar, the year it was produced). The data contained in the database should make it easy to find the nominees for the Oscar winners. It should be remembered that one film can win an award in several categories as well as a person. For each person, in addition to his data, a link should be made between the film to explain what film he was working on.
